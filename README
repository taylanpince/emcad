EMCAD Web Site
==============

A simple content management system for EMCAD. All content and graphics are
editable through the admin. There is a special app for projects.


Installation
------------

Use pip to install your library requirements, using virtualenv is recommended,
but not necessary:

	pip install -r conf/requirements.pip

Create your database and user. Settings file is setup for PostgreSQL, but can
easily be changed to use MySQL. Create a symlink to the settings file:

	cd build/emcad
	ln -s ../../conf/settings.py settings_local.py

Update the conf/settings.py file with the database name and credentials if you
used something other than what's already in there.

Create a symlink for admin media files:

	cd build/emcad/media
	ln -s /path/to/django/contrib/admin/media admin

Create a files folder and make sure the server can write to it:

	cd build/emcad/media
	mkdir files
	chown -R www-data:www-data files

Finally, synchronize your database:

	cd build/emcad
	./manage.py syncdb
	./manage.py migrate

It will ask you to create an admin account on first run. Don't forget to pass
those credentials back to everyone involved.
